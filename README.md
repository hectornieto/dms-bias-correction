# DMS Bias Correction

## Synopsis

This project contains the *Python* code for enhancing the dynamic LST range of sharpened LST scenes, by fusing them with Landsat LST imagery. 

The project consists of: 

1. a lower-level module `dms_bias_correction.scale_lst.py` with the basic functions needed for the bias correction approach 
2. a higher-level module `dms_bias_correction.landsat_collection_2_helper.py`for easily running the correction by reading [Landsat Collection 2 Level 2](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2-level-2-science-products)

## Installation

Download the project to your local system, enter the download directory and then type

`python setup.py install` 

if you want to install pyTSEB and its low-level modules in your Python distribution. 

The following Python libraries will be required:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- scikit-image
- GDAL
- pyDMS, at [https://github.com/radosuav/pyDMS](https://github.com/radosuav/pyDMS)

With `conda`, you can create a complete environment with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Code Example
### High-level example

The easiest way to get a feeling of the sharpening enhancement is throught the example script [test_dms_correction](./test_dms_correction.py)
In a terminal shell, navigate to your working folder and type

- `python test_dms_correction.py` 

The script will read all the Landsat images and compute the reference dynamic range that will be used to correct the sharpened S3 LST image. Then it will compare the corrected and uncorrected DMS image to a Landsat scene acquired on the same date and plot the results in [test/dms_corr_best_case](./test/dms_corr_best_case)

### Low-level example

## Tests
The folder *./test* contains an example for running the correction of a DMS sharpened image, at [test/dms_raw](./test/dms_raw), using a time series of downloaded Landsat Collection 2 Level 2 scenes, located at [test/landsat](./test/landsat). The output will be stored at [test/dms_corr_best_case](./test/dms_corr_best_case) and could be compared to the actual LST Landsat scene of the same date in [test/landsat_reference](./test/landsat_reference)
